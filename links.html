	<p>Find A Grave's mission is to find, record, and present final disposition information from around the world as a virtual cemetery experience.  This web site enables searches for persons buried in cemeteries around the world.  All entries in Find A Grave have been entered by volunteers.  While the majority of the graves at Pleasant Hill have been catalogued on Find A Grave, many have not.  Pleasant Hill Cemetery has not compiled this information, nor does it vouch for its accuracy.  We are simply providing a link to another web site that we think might be useful for our members.</p>
