		<li>All memorial foundations shall be placed on solid ground not included in actual grave space except where grave liner is of permanent type and of sufficient strength to support the weight of the foundation and memorial, and will not interfere with future grave openings. Foundations for all upright monuments and horizontal markers shall be four inches wider and longer than the base dimension of the monument for a depth of at least 24 inches. This is to facilitate monument alignment and aesthetics following grass trimming. All horizontal markers must be set on a concrete base no less than 8 inches deep. Soil conditions below the surface are unpredictable.</li>
		<li>Monuments or markers shall be placed at the head of the lot as platted. No more than one marker shall be placed at any one grave except that on an old lot, existing markers may be duplicated. On multiple lots for entire families where a headstone or monument serves two or more graves, the headstone or monument will be on a line centered between the lots. Markers may then denote each individual grave. No monument or marker shall be set unless it is first approved by the Cemetery Board. On a lot containing both a family monument and individual grave markers, the individual grave markers shall be placed with top surface at ground level.</li>
